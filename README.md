#Conservation areas as data NFT


Conservation areas have an explicit value for securing carbon stocks and protecting endangered species, as well as protecting the territorial rights of indiginous peoples in many countries. What I propose is that the data that can be extracted from these areas also carries a great value. A few examples:

##Carbon data
Just simple carbon dioxide emission and absorption numbers are already quite valuable in a climate change reality. Commercially, these numbers can also be used to benchmark reforestation efforts and carbon market transactions.

##Ecological data
With the increase of the definition of data extracted from these areas, one has access to information about the population of seed spreaders, fungi networks, invasive species, nutrient stocks and a lot more. With that, one can build better models to predict the carbon absorption rates of a forest, its growth rate, polen clouds, soil yields based on metagenomics, water stock models, and much, much more. The more detailed and diverse the data, the more valuable insights and models we can extrapolate from it.

##Health data
The field of environmental epigenetics studies how external factors affect the genetic expression of cells. Epigenetics are a huge factor in human health, and yet there’s very little concrete data about specific environmental factors, particularly those that are not of industrial origin. From tracking new virus species developing in the wild, to the spread of wild pathogens in the human population, the potential to improve human health with conservation areas data is very promising.

##How can this become an NFT?
Each area is a unique local biome. One can’t right click copy the carbon absorption data from a protected area in the southern Amazon, or the population of lemurs in a Madagascar wildlife reserve. 
The biome data is also time sensitive. New measurements will always be different than previous ones. Collected, they become more valuable; a month’s worth collection carries more predictive value. Rarity also exists naturally for individual data points, with outliers that will always carry repercussions to the biome.

##But how can this offline data be onboarded onto the chain?

With boots on the ground to collect that data. These can be scientists, local communities around the area or indigenous populations. The more detailed and diverse the measurements, and the more constant they are, the more rewarding the data collection work should be. No satellite will count the eggs in a nest of macaws, no drone will collect soil samples from 2m underground, no ML algorithm will predict what viruses a swallow picked up in Namibia.

In many cases, data is not collected for lack of financial support. The actors that are capable of doing it and present in those areas are, more often than not, underfunded. This generates a positive feedback of data waste: the informational value of the area is not explored because no one pays for it, and no one pays for it because there’s no one to go out there and take the measurements.

The same way NFTs brought prosperity to many digital artists, the same can be done for people in and around conservation areas.

The data NFT is minted by the people that went into the field and took the numbers; They own it, and can stake it, lease it, sell it, etc. They can form cooperatives to promote better control and marketing of their data assets, and to better manage the data collection work. The better curated their data is, the more valuable it becomes. 

There are already several programs to engage local communities in the conservation of natural areas; A great start would be to engage these initiatives as the first field data crafters.

##Value and utility
The value of this data is not tied to virtual assets. No bubble bursting that will affect the value of this kind of data. You can’t take the forest down with a DDoS attack. This data carries a solid, real value, and utility for current and future data analysis models. 

##The cherry on top: Optics
For an industry that gets so much backlash for the environmental implications, this looks good, and not in a gimmicky way. This is a legit ESG project with meaningful consequences. Investing in a NFT collection that promotes the conservation efforts of biomes and the well-being of the people involved in it, on top of great profit potential due to its utility, is really attractive.
